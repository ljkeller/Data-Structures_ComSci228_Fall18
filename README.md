Computer Science 228, Data Structures: Fall 18
==============================================

This is my classwork of Iowa State's Fall 18 Data Structures class taught by Dossay Oryspayev. While Dossay made the class far too challenging and is no longer teaching 228, this material really made me start to appreciate computer science. Inside is all of my assignments/projects- I averaged > ~97% on the homeworks and projects, so these should be safe to refer to for anyone.

I'm mainly posting these as a reference of my coding style in a language I'm comfortable with (java).
