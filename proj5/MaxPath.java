     * maxPath is not empty, then it throws IllegalArgumentException with the message "maxPath is not empty".
     *
     * This method calls depthFirstSearch(...) in the class DFS on G, and saves the reference to a stack of vertices
     * from depthFirstSearch(...) into the variable, say topoOrder, of type Stack<V>. If topoOrder is null, then it
     * throws IllegalArgumentException with the message "The graph has a cycle". If topoOrder is empty, then it throws
     * IllegalStateException with the message "topoOrder is empty".
     *
     * Then it creates a dist map and a pred map (see lecture code on Dijkstra's algorithm under week 13 of Lecture
     * Notes). And it sets the value to 0 for each vertex in the dist map, and sets the value to null for each vertex in
     * the pred map.
     *
     * For each vertex u in the stack topoOrder, removes u from the stack, and for each edge from u to v, if the cost of
     * the path to v via vertex u is larger than the current cost of v (given by dist.get(v)), then updates the current
     * cost of v with the larger cost and sets the value of v to u in the pred map (see lecture code on Dijkstra's
     * algorithm, i.e., DiGraph.java).
     *
     * Let variable, say score, of type Integer be the maximum distance of any path seen so far and let variable, say
     * end, of type V be the ending vertex of a path with the distance score. Initially, score is set to 0 and end to
     * null. Whenever the distance of a new path ending at vertex v is larger than score, this method, sets score to the
     * larger distance and sets end to v.
     *
     * At the end of this method, score is the maximum distance of all paths in the graph and a path with this maximum
     * distance ends at the vertex end. Uses the pred map to generate each vertex in this path in reverse order,
     * starting at the vertex end, and places the vertices in the stack maxPath with the stack top being the first
     * vertex in this path. Note that the pred value for the first vertex is null.
